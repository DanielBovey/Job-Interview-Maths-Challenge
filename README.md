# Job-Interview-Maths-Challenge
A maths game inspired by a very similar test I have come across in job interview assessments.

Written with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game randomly generates equations using between 0 - 2 operators on each side. 

I'm relatively new to CSS and Javascript - particularly when it comes to animations - so I am continually updating this code to make it cleaner as I learn.

Updates coming soon to include difficulty scaling as the number of subsequent correct answers increases and leaderboards and other statistics.
